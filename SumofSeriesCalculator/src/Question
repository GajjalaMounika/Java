Problem Statement : Sum of Series Calculator

Question Description: Create a program that calculates the sum of the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n. The program should accept an integer 'n' as input.

Boiler Plate Code:

public class Main

{

public static void calculateSumOfSeries(int n)

{

// your code here

}

public static void main(String[] args) {

}

}

Sample Input: 5

Sample Output: 2.283333333333333
/*If inverse of a sequence follows rule of an A.P i.e, Arithmetic progression, then it is said to be in Harmonic Progression.In general, the terms in a harmonic progression can be denoted as : 1/a, 1/(a + d), 1/(a + 2d), 1/(a + 3d) …. 1/(a + nd). 
As Nth term of AP is given as ( a + (n – 1)d) .Hence, Nth term of harmonic progression is reciprocal of Nth term of AP, which is : 1/(a + (n – 1)d) 
where “a” is the 1st term of AP and “d” is the common difference.
We can use a for loop to find sum. */
